We respect your privacy and appreciate the importance of your trust. As part of our efforts to help you understand how we handle the personal information you share with us on our websites and related platforms (including, without limitation, social media pages, and mobile sites [collectively, the “Website”]), this Privacy Policy sets forth the categories of information that we may collect from you, how such information is collected, our business purposes for collecting such information, and how certain information may be shared with our business partners.

## Types of Information We Collect

We may collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with you, your household, or your device. The following table describes the categories and specific types of personal information that we collect, and how long we retain such personal information:

## How We Collect Personal Information

### Information Provided By You:

The type of personal information that we collect depends on your use of the Website and what information you provide to us. For example:

- If you sign up for our Luxe Loyalty Rewards, you will be required to provide us with your email and a password.

  For more information about our Luxe Loyalty Rewards, please see our Terms and Conditions here.

### Information We Receive:

We and our third-party service providers may also use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how our Website is accessed and used (known as “Usage Information”) by you. “Usage Information” may include the type of browser and device you used to access our Website, your operating system and application version, the web pages accessed by you, the time you accessed these web pages, preceding web page views, and your use of any features or applications on our Website. Statistical data like this helps us understand what is interesting and relevant to our customers, so we can best adapt our content for our customers&apos; benefit.

We and our third-party service providers may also automatically collect an email address, IP address, location, carrier information or other unique identifier information from the computer, mobile device, or other device you use to access our Website, and from other sources, such as data analytics providers, marketing or advertising service providers, fraud prevention service providers, vendors that provide services on our behalf, or publicly available sources. We may use this information to, amongst other things, administer our Website, help diagnose server problems, analyze trends, track web page movements, improve our services, match collected information to postal addresses, help identify you and your shopping cart, help us tailor special offers to you, and gather broad demographic information for collected use.

### Cookies and Other Technology:

Like many sites, our Website may employ cookies, JavaScript tags, web beacons or pixels (also known as clear GIF technology or “action tags”) to speed your navigation of our Website, recognize you and your access privileges, and track usage of our Website. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored as text files by your Internet browser on your computer&apos;s hard drive. We use both persistent cookies and third-party cookies. Persistent and third-party cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our customers to enhance your experience on our Website. Persistent cookies are used to make it easier for you to navigate our Website and remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Third-party cookies are only used for short-term tracking. We also work with outside service providers to manage cookies in order to analyze your activities across our Website over time. This allows our providers to adapt certain advertisements and offers for you based on your online activity.

Most Internet browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You may download an opt-out cookie here to disable any and all cookies we employ to track and enhance your user experience—however, your ability to use the website will be then limited and/or unavailable.

Please note that this opt-out is cookie-based (i.e., a cookie must be on your computer to tell our systems that you have opted-out). If you delete, block or otherwise restrict all cookies, this opt-out may not be effective. Further, because different computers, mobile devices and different Internet browsers all require their own version of the opt-out cookie, you must perform this opt-out process on all computers and browsers for which you wish to be opted-out.

## Our Children's Policy

Our Website is not directed to children under the age of sixteen (16). Children may not use our Website or purchase our products, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of sixteen (16). We have no way of distinguishing the age of individuals who access our Website. If a child has provided us with personal information, the parent or guardian should contact us to remove the information and opt out of promotional opportunities using the contact link provided below.

## Use and Sharing of Your Information

We use the information that we collect about you for a variety of business and commercial purposes. We also may share your information with certain third parties who assist us in providing services to our customers.

The following chart shows how we use and share your personal information:

We also may share your personal information for the following reasons:

- To respond to subpoenas, court orders, and other legal process, or as otherwise required by law;
- To exercise our legal rights or to defend ourselves against legal claims, to enforce our contracts, to investigate, respond to and resolve problems or inquiries (including governmental inquiries), or to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain;
- In connection with an actual or potential merger, sale, acquisition, assignment, or transfer of all or part of our assets, affiliates, lines of business, or products and services, including at bankruptcy;
- With our affiliates, subsidiaries, or parent companies (“Affiliates”) who process personal information on our behalf as our service provider or with whom we have partnered with to jointly offer a product or joint promotion; and
- With your consent.

## Security and Your Information

No data transmission over the Internet or website can be guaranteed to be secure from intrusion. However, we and our service providers maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information in accordance with data protection legislative requirements. We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) when handling credit card data. We also recommend that you take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your account through shared or public computers, devices, and applications.

If you provide us with a payment card when placing an order on our website, we use third-parties to validate your card, authenticate your identity and “tokenize” your payment credentials to make your payments more secure. Your “tokenized” credentials will be stored in your account in order to help make future purchases more convenient. You may delete or edit the stored payment methods in your account at any time by visiting our website or contacting customer support.

## How Long We Will Retain Your Information

We will not retain your personal information for longer than necessary. Your e-mail address will be retained on our mailing list until you request that we stop sending you advertising communications. We will retain your other personal information in order to provide you with the ability to act on our product warranties, to fulfill any product subscriptions and/or for business record and legal purposes.

For example, we may keep just enough of your personal information to ensure that we comply with your request to erase your personal information, or to exercise or defend our legal claims.

## Third-Party Links and services

Our Website may contain links to third-party websites and products and services, such as paying for product orders through PayPal®. We do not control such linked websites and this Privacy Policy does not apply to those websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policy of any third-party website that you visit before you provide any information to that website&apos;s owner.

## Changes and Updates to Our Privacy Policy

We may change this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice to you. Any changes that we make will be effective immediately upon our posting of the revised Privacy Policy on our Website. Your continued use of our Website constitutes your consent to any changes made. We will use your personal information in a manner consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time you submitted your personal information, unless you later consent to a revised policy. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.

## Your Personal Information Rights Under State Law

As you may know, certain states have enacted laws that provide their residents with certain rights with respect to the access and control of their personal data. For your convenience, we have summarized these rights here. In the event you wish to contact us regarding any of these rights, or for any other reason, please refer to the instructions provided in Section 11 below.

- Access your personal data: You have the right to request that we disclose what categories of personal information we collect, use, disclose and sell. However, we are not obligated to provide you with this information more than twice in a twelve (12) month period.

- Delete your personal data: You have the right to request that we delete your personal information that we have collected and/or maintained.

  Opt-out of automated decision making: You have the right to opt-out of automated decision-making technology.
- Opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal data: You have the right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information by a business. Our use of tracking technologies may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” under applicable law. You can opt-out of being tracked by these third parties by clicking the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link at the bottom of our website and selecting your preferences or by broadcasting an Opt-Out Preference signal, such as the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) on the browsers and/or browser extensions that support such a signal. Please note that your use of our website may still be tracked by us and/or our service providers. We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age.
  - Categories of personal information disclosed that may be considered “sale”/ “sharing” under applicable law: Identifiers; Protected classification characteristics under California or federal law; Commercial Information; Internet or other similar network activity; Geolocation data; Sensory Data; Inferences drawn from other personal information; Sensitive personal information.
  - Categories of third parties to whom personal information was disclosed that may be considered “sale”/ “sharing” under applicable law: Service providers (including, but not limited to, advertisers and marketing partners, data analytics providers, and social media networks) and Affiliates.
- No Retaliation or Discrimination: We will not receive discriminatory treatment by us nor will we retaliate against you in response to your exercise of your privacy rights pursuant to applicable law.
- Authorized Agent: You have the right to designate an authorized agent to make a request pursuant to applicable law on your behalf. Please note that you must provide your authorized agent written permission to so act on your behalf, and your authorized agent must provide us with a copy of this document.
- Notice of Financial Incentive: Under California law, loyalty rewards points earned under Luxe Loyalty Rewards may be considered a financial incentive provided in exchange for the collection and retention of personal information. While we do not assign a monetary value to the data that we collect, based on our reasonable estimate, the value received from the driving insights and the Luxe Loyalty Rewards is reasonably equal to the value of the free or discounted products or other benefits that you obtain or that are provided as part of the Luxe Loyalty Rewards, less the expense related to our provision of those products and benefits to you. You may withdraw from the Luxe Loyalty Rewards at any time by contacting us using the designated method set forth in the Luxe Loyalty Rewards Terms and Conditions, found here.

Please note that while we will try to accommodate your requests, there may be times when we might not be able to help. For example, if you have recently purchased a product from us and this product is still within its applicable Money Back Guarantee period, we will not be able to honor a request to erase your personal data unless you first agree to waive your right to the Money Back Guarantee.

## California "Shine the Light" Inquirires

In addition to Section 9 above, Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code permits California residents who have provided their personal information to us to request data regarding our disclosure of their information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.

In the event you wish to contact us regarding the foregoing, please refer to the instructions provided in Section 11 below. Please specify in your communication that you are making a “California Shine the Light” inquiry.
